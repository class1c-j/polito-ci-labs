# Lab 9

## Algorithm

- I implemented a $(\lambda, \mu)$ strategy with islands and elitism concepts;
- For mutation I randomly flip a percentage of bits in the range of 1% and 5%;
- For crossover I do two point crossover;
- I stop the algorithm after 250 consecutive generations with no improvement

## Results

- For **problem instance 1** i got fitness 0.835, 2246549 fitness calls;
- For **problem instance 2** i got fitness 0.722, 2510219 fitness calls;
